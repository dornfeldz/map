# React Leaflet App

Welcome to my React Leaflet project, an innovative application designed to help users effortlessly browse nearby shops and services, and book appointments right within the app. Shop owners can easily register their businesses, manage sales, and appointments, making ShopApp a comprehensive platform for both users and business owners.
